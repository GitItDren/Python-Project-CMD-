# Houses:  The Lost American Dream
## General Information
The American Dream, since it was first used in the early 1930’s has represented a belief that every individual, regardless of their background, could pursue a life they envisioned for themselves.  Central to this dream is the idea that with hard work and dedication a life of prosperity and happiness could be attained through home ownership.  It has long been understood that by owning a home, one might gain financial independence and even wealth, not to mention a place to call one’s own.
However, the American Dream and the hope many have of home ownership has faced significant challenges during the past 20 years.  This is why we have entitled our project, **Houses:  The Lost American Dream** and have hypothesized that the correlation between Federal Reserve policy and home prices has effectively made owning a home for many elusive if not outright unattainable.
Our project, **Houses:  The Lost American Dream** looks at how one contributing factor, the Federal fund rate impacted averaged home prices in four cities, during the 20 year period between 1996 and 2016, to understand why many consider the American Dream……lost.
We will use *Python* and *Pandas* to create the code that will enable us to prove or disprove our hypothesis about the relationships between our variables and *MatplotLib* to make visual representations of the results.

To generate the results for our Project on your devices you will need to ensure you are using the source data we’ve provided and the same applications we’ve used to complete our project, **Houses:  The Lost American Dream**

## Project Steps
1. **Topic Exploration & Creating a Hypothesis –** Discussed various topics of group interest.  Ultimately decided upon the correlation between Home Prices and Interest Rates because of recent news reports of Federal Reserve activity.  We were interested in discovering what overall impact these policy changes have had, historically.
2. **Data Gathering -** Researched and collected from several sources the Federal Effective Fund Rate and the Housing Price Indices for the 20 years between 1996-2003
3. **Data Cleaning -** The time and effort spent preparing, modifying and merging the data to ensure we would have quality data for our analyses and visualization steps.
4. **Visualizing –** From the datasets, we created variables and axes to create multiple line plots that visualized how interest rates and federal/state housing prices fluctuate.
5. **Analyzing –** Reviewed the graphs and made assumptions about the actual data compared to our initial Hypothesis
6.	**Presentation –** Created a PowerPoint template to present the components of our project.  We each contributed summary information on the slides we are to present to the class.
